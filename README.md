# Web API - Web POS System

## Overview
This project is a Web POS (Point of Sale) system that provides a RESTful API for managing various entities within a POS environment. The system is built using JavaEE, with JSON handling, JNDI for database connectivity, and AJAX for client-side interactions. The primary focus of this system is to offer CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing customers, items, and orders.

## Technologies Used
- **JavaEE**: Core technology for building the RESTful Web Services.
- **JSON**: For data interchange between the client and the server.
- **JNDI**: Used for managing database connections via DataSource.
- **AJAX**: For asynchronous data requests and updates on the client-side.

## Features
- **Customer Management**: Create, retrieve, update, and delete customer records.
- **Item Management**: CRUD operations for managing items in the inventory.
- **Order Management**: Handle orders, including adding items to orders and processing them.
- **Database Connectivity**: Managed via JNDI to ensure secure and efficient access to the database.
